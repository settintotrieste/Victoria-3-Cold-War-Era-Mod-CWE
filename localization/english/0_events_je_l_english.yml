The new agreement proved broadly satisfactory to the parties involved, and the separatist tensions soon eased. The autonomous status granted in 1972 has resulted in a considerable level of self-government, and also allows the entity to retain almost 90% of all levied taxes."

Tito received US backing in Yugoslavia's successful 1949 bid for a seat on the United Nations Security Council, against Soviet opposition.

For Eastern Bloc countries, the Sino-Soviet split was a question of who would lead the revolution for world communism, and to whom (China or the USSR) the vanguard parties of the world would turn for political advice, financial aid, and military assistance.

These modern-day threats continue to plague the maritime industry, jeopardising the safety of seafarers and vessels worldwide. Their consequences extend far beyond the immediate danger – they have a ripple effect, impacting shipping companies, disrupting global trade, and destabilising entire regions. \n\nDetours due to piracy hotspots add significant distances to shipping routes. This translates to higher fuel consumption, longer journey times, and ultimately, increased transportation costs for consumers and businesses. Furthermore, the increased risk drives up insurance premiums for ships and cargo. This additional cost burden further impacts shipping companies and potentially gets passed on to consumers. \n\nOn the other hand, piracy disrupts the smooth flow of goods around the world. Cargo delays or rerouting can lead to shortages, price fluctuations, and unreliable delivery schedules. This can affect entire supply chains and hinder economic activity."
